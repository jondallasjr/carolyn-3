    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <p>Answers to common questions about the DTV visa, medical tourism, living in Chiang Mai, and the relocation process.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-content">
    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2>DTV Visa</h2>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is the DTV visa?</h3>
        <p>The DTV (Digital Nomad Visa) is a long-term Thai visa designed for remote workers, digital nomads, and people receiving passive income or healthcare services. It's valid for 5 years and allows stays of up to 180 days per entry.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do I need a visa to enter Thailand initially?</h3>
        <p>No. US citizens receive a 60-day visa exemption automatically upon arrival. You can use this time to set up your medical plan and gather documents before applying for the DTV from Vietnam.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why do I need to apply for the DTV from Vietnam instead of Thailand?</h3>
        <p>Thai law requires DTV applications to be submitted from outside Thailand. Most applicants use the Thai embassy in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City because these locations have very high approval rates (often 95%+) and faster processing times (2-7 days).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What documents do I need for the DTV application?</h3>
        <p>Required documents include: a valid passport, medical plan with letters from Thai doctors confirming 6+ months of ongoing treatment, proof of financial sponsorship (bank statements showing 500,000+ THB), and a sponsorship letter from your financial sponsor. All documents must be error-free—typos cause automatic rejection.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How much does the DTV cost?</h3>
        <p>The application fee is $340 USD (paid to the embassy). You may also incur costs for medical consultations (~$40-90), medical letters, travel to Vietnam, and accommodation during processing.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I stay in Thailand while my DTV is being processed?</h3>
        <p>No. You must remain outside Thailand during processing. Most applicants stay in Vietnam for 2-7 days while waiting for approval. You cannot return to Thailand until your DTV is approved and stamped.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's the approval timeline for the DTV?</h3>
        <p>Official processing time is 5 working days, but in reality it ranges from 2 days to 2 weeks. The Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City embassies are known for faster approvals. The embassy may request additional documents, which can extend the timeline.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What happens after my DTV is approved?</h3>
        <p>You'll receive DTV approval electronically via email. Print multiple copies and return to Thailand with your passport. Present the printed approval at immigration, and your 5-year DTV will be stamped into your passport. You can then stay in Thailand for 180 days, with the option to extend for another 180 days or do a border run.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2>Medical Tourism & Health</h2>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I get a medical plan for the DTV?</h3>
        <p>Contact Bangkok Hospital or another English-speaking medical facility in Chiang Mai. Schedule an in-person consultation (typically $40-90) to discuss your medical needs. The doctor will create a medical plan outlining 6+ months of ongoing treatment, which becomes part of your DTV application.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Are my US medications available in Thailand?</h3>
        <p>Yes, many US medications are available in Thailand at a fraction of US prices. However, bring a 90-day supply from the US as backup. Bring US medical records including surgeries, MRIs, X-rays, and prescriptions from your doctor to facilitate getting medications from Thai pharmacies.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How much does physical therapy cost in Thailand?</h3>
        <p>Physical therapy in Thailand typically costs $25-75 per session, compared to $100+ in the US. Bangkok Hospital and other private clinics offer high-quality care at a fraction of Western prices.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What medical facilities are available in Chiang Mai?</h3>
        <p>Chiang Mai has several 24/7 English-speaking hospitals and clinics, including Bangkok Hospital (highly recommended for DTV medical letters), Chiang Mai RAM Hospital, and numerous private clinics. Research facilities before arrival and identify your primary care provider.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Should I get travel health insurance?</h3>
        <p>Yes, it's strongly recommended. Arrange travel health insurance before departure that covers your medical conditions and ongoing treatment in Thailand.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2>Living in Chiang Mai</h2>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How much does it cost to live in Chiang Mai?</h3>
        <p>Housing in the Suthep area ranges from $250-500/month for a furnished apartment. Food, transportation, and utilities are very affordable. Most people estimate $800-1,500/month for a comfortable lifestyle including housing.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's the Suthep area like?</h3>
        <p>Suthep is a popular expat neighborhood in northern Chiang Mai with a large English-speaking community, many restaurants with Western and Thai cuisine, easy access to amenities, and a strong community of digital nomads and long-term residents. It has good transportation links via Grab (motorcycle taxi/car app) and is close to physical therapy clinics and hospitals.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I get around Chiang Mai?</h3>
        <p>Download the Grab app for inexpensive motorcycle taxis and cars. ATM withdrawals cost 220 THB ($6.50) per transaction. Public transportation is also available but English information is limited.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What recovery resources are available?</h3>
        <p>Chiang Mai has 50+ AA meetings per week. There are also Buddhist recovery meetings and Refuge Recovery programs. Many recovery-focused rehabs (like The Cabin) have alumni networks and counseling available.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Are there social activities for expats?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Chiang Mai has active expat communities with groups focused on yoga, hiking, art, cooking, board games, and volunteering (including English teaching and women's organizations). Join Facebook groups before arrival to connect with the community.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What about the burning season and air quality?</h3>
        <p>March-May is the burning season when air quality can be poor in northern Thailand. Many people take trips to southern Thailand, Bali, or return home during these months.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is English widely spoken?</h3>
        <p>In tourist areas and expat neighborhoods like Suthep, English is widely spoken. However, learning basic Thai is helpful and appreciated by locals. Many healthcare providers, restaurants, and services in popular expat areas have English speakers.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2>Relocation Timeline & Planning</h2>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long should I plan for the entire relocation process?</h3>
        <p>Typically 3-4 months from pre-departure preparation to DTV approval. This includes pre-departure tasks (1-2 months), initial settling in Thailand (2-3 weeks), medical planning (3-4 weeks), and DTV application/approval (2-3 weeks including the Vietnam trip).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's the optimal timeline for applying for the DTV?</h3>
        <p>Apply after your 60-day tourist visa exemption is nearly expiring (around day 50-55). This gives you time to set up your medical plan and gather documents during your first month in Thailand.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Should I get a 30-day tourist extension?</h3>
        <p>Optional. If you need extra time before your DTV application, you can extend your tourist visa at the Chiang Mai immigration office for 1,900 THB ($57), bringing your total stay to 90 days.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What should I do before I leave the US?</h3>
        <p>Get prescriptions refilled, gather US medical records (surgeries, MRIs, X-rays), get your passport, arrange travel health insurance, book temporary accommodation for the first 2 weeks in Thailand, buy your flight, join Chiang Mai Expat Facebook groups, and research nearby amenities in your desired neighborhood.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do I need a financial sponsor for the DTV?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Your sponsor must provide bank statements showing 500,000+ THB (~$15,000 USD) for 3+ months, a sponsorship letter committing to financial support in emergencies, and proof of relationship (such as a birth certificate if family).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's the first week in Thailand like?</h3>
        <p>Plan for 3 quiet days to settle in. Go to nearby grocery stores, download and set up Grab for transportation, and rest. In your first 1-2 weeks, set up basic services: find a cleaner, identify a primary care doctor, connect with a physical therapist, locate pharmacies, and attend AA or recovery meetings to find a community and sponsor.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2>Vietnam Trip for DTV Application</h2>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do I need a Vietnamese visa?</h3>
        <p>Yes, US citizens need a Vietnamese visa. Online visas cost approximately $25 and can be obtained through online services. Budget $400-600 total for your Vietnam stay including visa, accommodation, and food.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where should I apply for the DTV—Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City?</h3>
        <p>Both embassies have high approval rates and reasonable processing times. Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City are the most popular choices. Choose based on your flight availability and personal preference.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long will I stay in Vietnam?</h3>
        <p>Typically 5-14 days. You'll arrive with your complete application, submit it within 24 hours, and wait 2-7 days for approval. The embassy may request additional documents during this time.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What accommodation should I book in Vietnam?</h3>
        <p>Budget $30-40 per night for decent accommodation. Many travelers use Airbnb or local hotels. Book flexible accommodation in case processing takes longer than expected.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What happens if the embassy requests more documents?</h3>
        <p>Stay in Vietnam until you can provide them. Have digital copies of all your documents and be prepared to make copies at local shops if needed. Keep your sponsor available by phone/email to provide additional documentation quickly.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2>Visa & Immigration</h2>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do I need a visa before traveling to Thailand?</h3>
        <p>No. US citizens automatically receive a 60-day visa exemption upon arrival in Thailand. No pre-arranged visa is required for initial entry.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's a "re-entry permit"?</h3>
        <p>If you need to leave Thailand and return while on the DTV, you can obtain a re-entry permit. However, with the DTV you don't need re-entry permits for the 5-year duration of your visa.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long can I stay in Thailand with the DTV?</h3>
        <p>The DTV allows stays of up to 180 days per entry. You can extend for another 180 days (total 360 days) or do a border run to reset your entry. Border runs typically involve flying to a nearby country and returning the same day.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's a border run?</h3>
        <p>A border run is a trip outside Thailand (to Laos, Malaysia, or another nearby country) and return on the same day to reset your visa entry date. With a DTV, you can do border runs every 180 days if preferred, though extending your stay is another option.</p>
